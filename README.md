# Mini-Projects
Welcome to the repository showcasing fundamental web development projects inspired by Brad Traversy's Udemy courses on HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. In this collection, you'll find hands-on projects I built following Brad's engaging and practical teaching style.

These projects cover fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript practices while introducing unique scenarios to ensure well-rounded exposure for a beginner like myself.
